# 👋 Hey, wanna help with Smart Blob Engine?

First up—thanks for even thinking about pitching in! People like you are why open source rocks.

We're all about keeping this project **simple**, **fun**, and **not bloated**.

## 🐛 Found something broken?

If the blob's glitching out, vanishing, or just being weird, give us a shout!

1. Head to the **Issues** tab on GitHub.
2. Hit **New Issue**.
3. Give us the deets:
   * **What went down?** (Like "Blob got stuck to the ceiling lol")
   * **How can we make it happen too?** (Try "Scroll like a maniac")
   * **What browser?** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)

## 💡 Got a cool idea?

Think the blob should blink, change colors, or make fart noises? Open an **Issue** and slap a "Feature Request" label on it. We're all ears!

## 💻 Wanna code?

Hell yeah! Here's how to get your hands dirty:

1. **Fork** this repo (that button up top right).
2. **Clone** it to your machine.
3. Tweak stuff.
4. **Commit** with a chill message (Like "Fixed that jumpy bug").
5. Push your changes and make a **Pull Request**.

### ⚠️ Ground rules

To keep this thing speedy and clean, stick to these:

* **No extra baggage:** Don't toss in jQuery, GSAP, or React. Standalone only.
* **Keep it readable:** Code shouldn't look like alien hieroglyphics.

## 📄 Legal stuff
